          <P> George R.R. Martin's best-selling book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families --
            kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men -- playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne.

          <h2>Why I like Game of throne</h2>
          <div class="G-1">
    
          <p><strong><em>It has an unpredictable story line that will make your heart beat at the speed of light. It's a mix of fantasy, action, adventure and suspense with the typical elements of drama and romance.</em></strong> Set in the
            middle/dark ages in an alternate universe, the story is about a bunch of strong families (known as 'houses') who want to ascend the Iron Throne (the throne on which the ruler of the seven kingdoms sit) Basically it's a story of cunning power
            play where everyone tries to one up each other. It's full of sly and strategic planning where you can trust no one. However, it doesn't stop to that. It has a healthy mix of fantasy elements like Dragons, magical creatures and hints of of
            magic to make it more interesting; with parallel story lines to enrich it.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones" target=_"blank"> Visit here for more information</a></p>

        <h2>My favourite Three actor/actress in Game Of Thrones</h2>
    
        <div class="G-02">
    
    
          <h4><strong>Alfie Allen<strong></h4><img class="p-3" src="https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2016/12/game_of_thrones_alfie_allen_SEASON_SEVEN_630.jpg" alt="GretJoy picture">
          <p>
    
            I could write a big rant about him, because he is one of the best actors out there and totally underrated just because his role hasn’t gained that much attention and liking!
            Theon Greyjoy had a character development like no one else. He started off as a cocky boy, transformed into an emotional wrack and into Reek, back to an entirely new personality.</p>
    
    
    
            <h4><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong></h4><img class="p-3" src="https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rts8haa.jpg" alt="Emilia Clarke Photo">
            <p>
    
              -Like Daenerys or not, you can’t deny that Emilia seems like a fantastic person in real life. Daenerys doesn’t show a lot of emotions - and I understand the critism aimed at her character/acting, but Emilia is totally different (at least
              in
              interviews and at appearances)
    
              Just go to Youtube and search up some of her interviews: they are great and she’s so hilarious.<br></p>
    
    
            <h4> <strong>Peter Dinklage</strong></h4>
            <img class="p-3" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2498598-game_of_thrones_tyrion_lannister.jpg" alt="Tyroin Lanniester photo">
            <p>
              Tyrion is one of the few characters left to root for, and in his performance, Peter Dinklage proves that it was the role he was born to play. Dinklage’s performance is bigger compared to some of the others on the show, and that totally
              works
              for his character. As the series goes on, Tyrion faces more and more physical and internal battles, which shows off Dinklage’s range more than it did in earlier seasons

          <h3>My best Quote from Game of Thrones </h3>
          <br>
          <p id="gizuf-bro"> “Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”
            <em>George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones </em> </p>

          <h3>Budget</h3>
          <br>
          <P>As the show has gotten more and more ambitious, the budget has reflected that shift as well. During season 2, the average budget per episode was $6 million USD. For season 6, that went all the way up to $10 million USD —
    
            making the entire season’s production budget $100 million USD.</P>
